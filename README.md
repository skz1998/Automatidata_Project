# Automatidata_Project
Used multiple regression to predict taxi fares, data that would be used as part of a suite of models to optimize revenue for the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission and its drivers.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a multiple linear regression to predict taxi fares.

## Business Understanding
According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is important to understand what factors encourage riders to leave tips in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage. 

## Conclusion
This model can benefit Taxi Drivers in knowing if they will be tipped generously or not; however, running a parametric model to determine how much each variable will influence the actual price of the tip. In the future, adding more information on a riderâ€™s past tipping behavior may also be beneficial in helping the stakeholder address their business problem.
